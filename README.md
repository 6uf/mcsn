### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my names Liza.
This project was made for fun in the span of a few hours, it uses a library i made, the sniper itself is a wip and will be updated over time. [Discord](https://discord.gg/usZQYuXdeU), A guide to the sniper will be in the discord channel as well so hop on in if you need any help!!
