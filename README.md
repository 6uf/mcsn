### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my names Liza.
#### i am the owner of Dismal.
This project was made for fun in the span of a few hours, it uses a library i made to work, the sniper itself is a wip and will be updated over time, mcsn uses sockets and multiple account types (preferablly microsoft and giftcard).

Usages:
- Only supports Giftcard and Microsoft accounts
- Saves bearers to a json file ON your computer, this is so bearers can auto expire and reauth FOR YOU (no more logging in everytime u launch a sniper)
- Can mix and match giftcard and microsoft accs to snipe with (preferablly 1 microsoft)
- uses command line arguments to run, Example: main.exe nametosnipe 57 (your delay)
