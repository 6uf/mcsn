### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my names Liza.
#### i am the owner of Dismal.
This project was made for fun in the span of a few hours, it uses a library i made to work, the sniper itself is a wip and will be updated over time, mcsn uses sockets and multiple account types (preferablly microsoft and giftcard).

Usages:
- Only supports Giftcard and Microsoft accounts
- Saves bearers to a json file ON your computer, this is so bearers can auto expire and reauth FOR YOU (no more logging in everytime u launch a sniper)
- Can mix and match giftcard and microsoft accs to snipe with (preferablly 1 microsoft)
- uses command line arguments to run, Example;
    - mcsn.exe snipe -u name -d 10 | "-u meow" Meow being the name you want so example "-u wow", "-d 10" 10 being your delay!
    - mcsn.exe ping | This gives you a rouch estimate of your ping to the minecraft servers, use it as a estimated delay range.
    - mcsn.exe auto 3c | automatically snipes all upcoming 3 characters onto your account(s).
    - mcsn.exe auto 3l | automatically snipes all upcoming 3 letters onto your account(s).
    - mcsn.exe auto 3n | automatically snipes all upcoming 3 numbers onto your account(s).
    - mcsn.exe auto list | snipes names from your Names list in accounts.json (choose what names u wanna go for)
    - mcsn.exe bot | launches the discord bot, this allows u to control the sniper from a discord bot.. some features are;
        - adding vpses to snipe off
        - adding accounts and names to your config file from the bot
        - sniping from discord (single name, 3c, 3l, 3n etc)
        - easy to use and has security so only you can access it.

3c, 3n, 3l, and list are all automatic snipers they loop through the names and attempt to snipe them one at a time you can sit back and relax while it snipes.
