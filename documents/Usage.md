# What if i wanna use the SRC?

Well you can!

Firstly if you dont have it install [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)

After go is installed, restart your computer so the changes are saved to your PC.
Download the code on the github website and extract the files to a folder on your desktop..

from there run `go run . ping` this will generate your usage files.

Now that your config files have been generated, open the accounts.txt file and add your accounts (email:password)
